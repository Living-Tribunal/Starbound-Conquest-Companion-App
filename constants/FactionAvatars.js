      "The Nova Raiders faction is a group that values wealth and freedom above all else. To many “civilized” cultures, they are labeled as outlaws or pirates, living on the fringes of society. They raid settlements and seize opportunities to steal from those who can’t defend themselves, preferring to strike when their targets are vulnerable. While they often favor cunning and deception, the Nova Raiders aren’t afraid to engage in all-out combat if the reward is worth the risk. Their infamy also stems from their willingness to hunt, blackmail, maim, and kill in their relentless pursuit of Aethorite—the most coveted material in the galaxy. Driven by greed, they aim to become the sole possessors of this precious resource, securing their dominance and ensuring their fortunes. To be a Nova Raiders Faction, is to know the galaxy is yours to plunder, and no one is safe from your ambitions.",

      "The Zyrrians faction are a people deeply rooted in trade and commerce, known for their vast travels across the galaxy in pursuit of goods and opportunities. Once a peaceful and passive society, their way of life was forever altered when their homeland was destroyed by the Lionfolk. While they continue their trading traditions, their approach now carries a sharp edge. No longer willing to be exploited, the Zyrrians have adopted a philosophy of resilience and strength. They negotiate with skill and determination but remain prepared to fight if necessary. Against the Lionfolk, their resolve hardens into vengeance—they will battle with relentless fury, refusing to yield until the last warrior stands. To join the Zyrrians faction is to embrace the art of negotiation while always keeping a hand near the trigger, ready for action if a deal turns sour. Trust, respect, and strength now define their place in the galaxy.",

Weakness is culled out of this race of warriors and boys and girls are trained from a young age to be the best soldiers the galaxy has ever seen. They are a people on conquest and dominate those they come against. They despise alien races and androids. They think anything not fully human is weak and needs to be wiped out. When they battle, “Retreat” is not in their vocabulary. They would rather fight to the last man than admit defeat. “To conquer is to live enough,” is their creed of life. They mine and harvest Aethorite, but they see it only as a means to an end. They do not covet it like some Factions do, but they will wipe a whole settlement if it is on a deposit of the precious material. To be a Voidborn Marauder is to covet victory and death is your mistress. ",

They are known to reap every ounce of material, recourses, and life from any they come across. The Star Reapers have so embodied total annihilation that in some cultures they have become the mythology of death itself. To be a Star Reaper is to be furiously loyal to your Faction, but everyone else are lambs for the slaughter. ",
