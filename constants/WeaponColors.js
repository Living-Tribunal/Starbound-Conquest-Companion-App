  "Medium Cannon":
    "A balanced main gun found on destroyers. Medium Cannons offer solid damage output and reliable range, making them the backbone of most small-to-mid combat vessels.",

  "Heavy Cannon":
    "Standard heavy armament on cruisers. Heavy Cannons deal substantial hull damage but have narrower firing arcs. Designed for head-on engagements.",

  "Plasma Cannon":
    "Side-mounted broadside weapons used by cruisers and dreadnoughts. Plasma Cannons release unstable energy in sweeping arcs from the left or right, making positioning critical. Excellent for flanking or crossing maneuvers.",

  "350mm Railgun":
    "Long-range, high-velocity kinetic weapon. Railguns are mounted on dreadnoughts and fire from the forward arc. Best suited for sniping across sectors and weakening heavily armored foes at a distance.",

  "Missile Battery":
    "A versatile, carrier-mounted weapon system capable of firing in a full 360Â° arc. Missiles are effective even against agile ships.",

  "Ion Particle Beam":
    "An experimental dreadnought-class energy weapon that **bypasses soak entirely**, dealing raw internal damage. Fires a focused beam from the forward arc. Highly effective against heavily shielded or reinforced ships.",
